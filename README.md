# OpenGL-Test

Everything works, except the Assimp binaries which I had problems compiling.
Hence even the Model.h class does not work as it depends on Assimp, So you can't really import a model but you can still use the Mesh.h class to make your objects.

Also no time for me to continue this project as I've moved on to WebDev T-T.
